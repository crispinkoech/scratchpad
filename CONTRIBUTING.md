## Contributing to Scratchy - :speech_balloon: [Join us on Discord](https://discord.gg/kxrSAd)

## :warning: Some pointers
Master branch is locked from force pull requests (PR). You **HAVE** to always create a new branch and commit your code to that branch. Then you need to issue a pull request from your github account.

Example:
```
git clone https://github.com/j-000/scratchpad.git
cd scratchpad/frontend
npm install
npm run serve
```
Now do some coding & contribute.
Once ready to commit:
```
git branch mybranchname // call the branch what you want
git checkout mybranchname
git add .
git commit -m "some message about my contribution"
git push -u origin mybranchname
```
Then you have to login into your github account and you should see the pull request button. In the pull request message, you can 
describe what you have done, how it benefits the application and if you have learned any new tech during the process.


## :grin: But how can you help? :thinking:
1) Start with updating the `README.md` and add your github username to the "collaborators" section. Yes - you need to create a new branch and issue a PR for this.
2) Checkout the [issues](https://github.com/j-000/scratchpad/issues) page first and see if there is something you can fix. :muscle:
3) If you want to introduce a new technology, [create an issue](https://github.com/j-000/scratchpad/issues/new) to start a discussion.
4) If you believe you can solve an issue, just comment on the issue that you will give it a try and then give it a go at solving it.

For anything else: `code ---> create a new branch --> pull request`. If I have any questions before merging to master I will create an issue myself and tag you. 

Remember to have fun and enjoy! This is meant to be a fun hobby for everyone :smile:
