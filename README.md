# Scratchy
This is a very simple project I started to help me with work related time keeping. 
There is no backend required for the application as it uses the localStorage to keep track of data.

This applications targets work productivity. If you're like me and need to keep track of how long you take
working on certain tasks, then this tool may help you. 

Current features:
- :notebook_with_decorative_cover: Note entry and management.
- :timer_clock: Time entry with short note.
- :file_folder: Everything is local! Your data stays on your browser (localStorage).


## Tech used:
- [Vuesjs](https://vuejs.org/) - single page applications made easy.
- [Vuex](https://vuex.vuejs.org/) - for easy state management.
- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) for people that are terrible with CSS (like me).
