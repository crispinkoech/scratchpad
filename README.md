This is a very simple project I started to help me with work related time keeping. 
There is no backend required for the application as it uses the localStorage to keep track of data.

This applications targets work productivity. If you're like me and need to keep track of how long you take
working on certain tasks, then this tool may help you. 

## Current features:
- :notebook_with_decorative_cover: Note entry and management.
- :timer_clock: Time entry with short note.
- :file_folder: Everything is local! Your data stays on your browser (localStorage).


## Tech used:
- [Vuesjs](https://vuejs.org/) - single page applications made easy.
- [Vuex](https://vuex.vuejs.org/) - for easy state management.
- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) for people that are terrible with CSS (like me).

## What to get involved?

### Project setup
```
git clone https://github.com/j-000/scratchpad.git
git branch "yourusername"
git checkout "yourusername"
npm install
npm run serve
```
Now do some coding. Master branch is protected from force pull requests. You need to create a new branch first (call it anything).

Feel free to make some suggestions, add new features and whatnot.

### Ideas for improvement:
- [x] - Add a logo
- [x] - Add more tabs/columns
- [x] - Time keeping
- [ ] - Move todos to different tabs
- [ ] - Add alert functionaity to the todos
- [ ] - Leverage 3rd party APIs for alerts (like twilio, SMTP or browser notifications API)
- [ ] - Add settings for customisation of alerts
- [ ] - Improved UI - maybe allow customisation
