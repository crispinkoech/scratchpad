# Scratchy
This is a very simple project I started to help me with work related time keeping. 
There is no backend required for the application as it uses the localStorage to keep track of data.

This applications tries to help with productivity. If you need, like me, to keep track of how long you take
working on certain tasks, then this tool may help you. There also a scratchpad for quick note entry.

Stack used:
- Vuesjs + Vuex for state management 
- Bootstrap for the layout 

You can try it out here:
